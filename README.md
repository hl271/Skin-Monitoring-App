# Skin Disease Detection App: A React Native mobile app that uses Computer Vision API to detect skin diseases

## Overview

### 1. Server Architecture

For the development of the server-side functions for our skin disease detection app, 
we use the following technical stacks:

- NodeJs Express Framework (for utility API)
- Flask Framework (for providing skin disease detection API)
- Firebase Authentication (for authentication)
- Firebase Storage (for image storage)
- Hasura GraphQL Engine (for providing instant GraphQL & REST APIs on existing PostgreSQL data source)
- PostgreSQL & nhost (for hosting PostgreSQL database)

### 2. Client Architecture

For our skin disease detection app, we use React Native (with Expo) as the main 
framework for developing our graphical interface. The details of our core libraries are:
- React Native: core UI framework
- Expo Go: open-source client for testing React Native apps on Android and iOS without building app locally
- NativeBase: UI library, providing styled components
- react-native-paper: UI library, providing Material UI styled components
- react-navigation: routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps
